# Filters

This folder is for high pass filtering any file. This may be needed in cases where the generated data maybe audible, i.e. filtering done by the library is not sufficient. The usage for the script is as follows :

```
    python3 filter.py wav_file_name cutoff attenuation
```

## Dependencies

To install dependencies run the following command:

```
    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-numpy python3-scipy
```
